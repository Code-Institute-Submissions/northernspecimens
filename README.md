# Northern Specimens

## Northern Specimens is a fully interactive website that is designed to educate the user around Taxidermy, allow them to book a course to learn Taxidermy and to purchase items. This buisness aims to teach the public how to preserve animals in unique ways, while profiting from the interest of the public. I designed this website as me and my partner own a small taxidermy buisness and we will be using a similar design for our own website. This website aims to create as much profit and traffic to the business as possible, while creating a positive user experience.
