# Northern Specimens

## Northern Specimens is a fully interactive website that is designed to educate the user around Taxidermy, allow them to book a course to learn Taxidermy and to purchase items. This buisness aims to teach the public how to preserve animals in unique ways, while profiting from the interest of the public. I designed this website as me and my partner own a small taxidermy buisness and we will be using a similar design for our own website. This website aims to create as much profit and traffic to the business as possible, while creating a positive user experience.

## Design

* The main colours used on the website are gold, black and white.
* The fonts used include: Dancing Script, Noto Sans JP and UnifrakturMaguntia.
* Imagery: The imagery is very unique, using an oak-wood pattern, naturally seen when planing the trunks of trees. A gradient is used to highlight the logo and brand name.

## Wireframes

## Features
* The index.html page is used to give an aire of mystery to the website and increase interest in the web-user. Inspiration was taken from Alice in Wonderland with the woodland background,
used to develop a hint to what Magnus Woodcraft is about.
* The home.html page holds the first nagivation and webpage that is seen once the user clicks on the enter button on the previous page.
A simple design is used to create more focus on the business itself, but a unique color palette is used to create consolidation and to make the site stand out visually.
* The about.html page is self-explanatory but is very visual rather than giving the user lots of verbal information that is more difficult to remember. The images and carousels are used
to create a simple ideas board that the user can then take with them, before designing their own custom order. 
* The projects page is designed to attract attention from a more professional and
wider reaching audience. This page also showcases the abilities of the carpentry company, showing potential buyers the levels of expertise that the carpenters possess. 

* Finally the order.html and thank.html pages allow the user to submit their details, orders and ideas to the business. Allowing for simple and easy communication to the company. The thank.html page was developed as I was
unable to code for an order form submission technique using PHP.
* The website is fully responsive on all device sizes such as desktop, tablet and phone.

### Future features
* Future features to include into the website would be a blog, shop page and review/comments section.


## Technologies used:
Languages used: **HTML5 and CSS3**
* The project relies heavily on the [Bootstrap 4.4.1 CDN](http://getbootstrap.com/) to simplify resolution responses across all media platforms, allowing full responsiveness for both text and images through fluid-containers, carousels and Bootstrap-grid.
* [Google Fonts](http://fonts.google.com/) and [Font Awesome libraries](http://fontawesome.com/6?next=%2F) used to allow a more unique design and variability than standard HTML/CSS3 font.
* [Hover.css](http://ianlunn.github.io/Hover) allows for an alteration of visuals such as font color, family and changes to other features such as button size etc upon the cursor passing over the object.
* [J Query](http://jquery.com/) was precoded into the template used for this project. 
* [Git](http:///git-scm.com) was used as a browser add on to allow the commit of data to the repository from GitPod.
* [GitHub](http://github.com) was used to store the code after it was pushed from GitPod using Git.

## Further testing
1. Navigation: Each navigational link directs the user to the desired page. For example, clicking on the Home link takes the user to the home page, clicking the about link takes the user to the about page etc.
2. Navigation scrolling bar: Navigation bar remains fixed at the top of the page even when scrolling down.
3. Image responses: Images on all pages are fully responsive and are increased/decreased to an appropriate size and resolution across all screen sizes.
4. Content position: All fonts, page sections, carousels, headings, sub-headings, text sections, images and order-form remain in their appropriate positions and do not over-lap eachother, their respective parent divs or misalign, regardless of screen size. This was achieved by clicking "Open Source" after every alteration in the CSS code and running the new code, whilst expending and shrinking the display screen.
5. Order form: The order form on the order.html page submits to the thank.html page only when all text fields have their respective information.
6. Tested on all screen sizes, samsung galaxy s10, desktop and tablet.

* **Unfixed Bugs:** 
1. The social media links do not seem to work on the open server, and the social media pages for this company do not exist yet.
2. Sometimes the page needs to be refreshed to get the navbar to stick.
